# debugger

You can play this until 4th april, 11.59 PM. Time will be recorded. 

This is a flutter project.

The code contains bugs and aliens maybe. There are hints in the code.
Make sure you look carefully. What we ignored or laughed at might be important.

You will find this useful -> https://www.facebook.com/itfsu/ (not now but later)

You can use a Postman (https://www.postman.com/) like application to try the http requests.
Dio (https://pub.dev/packages/dio) library is added to the packages for http requests.
Tip from the creator: Use Postman. 

(Requests per 5 minutes is limited to 2. You have to wait 5 minutes if you send server requests twice)

Make sure to pull if there are new changes. That might save you trouble.

Good Luck 😁

One more thing. You either get 100 marks or 0 marks for this task. You can't just "debug partially" and be happy right? 😅
